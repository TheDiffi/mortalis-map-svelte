## Description
Arfast has seen his fair share of battles. Standing at over 2 metres tall, he boasts the body of a heavy strongman. His body is covered in tattoos of wolves, divine runes, and the holy symbol of Silvanus.
## Background
He lived with his warrior tribe, when one day they were chased from their own homeland by the forces of a mighty kingdom. Arfast made his name as a mercenary, a furious warrior. His faith in Silvanus as well as his fury is what kept him alive up until now and he will continue fighting to please his god.
