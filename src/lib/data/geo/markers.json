His body is covered in tattoos of wolves, divine runes, and the holy symbol of Silvanus.\n## Background\nHe lived with his warrior tribe, when one day they were chased from their own homeland by the forces of a mighty kingdom. Arfast made his name as a mercenary, a furious warrior. His faith in Silvanus as well as his fury is what kept him alive up until now and he will continue fighting to please his god. "

Then we finally had a talk about how she can help me reach my mother, unbeknownst to Elai, to finally kill her. She told us the next meditation would take place the next night, so we spend our night and day with some meditation and trying to kind of find some grounding in our souls. Letting in the cold was not as easy as it was before. Maybe that's a good sign. \n> The next evening we went out to the lake with some others and Elai to do the dream travel. Turns out it was actually planar travel and we landed in Stygia, where Levistus is being held captive by Asmodeus. That is why the cult is there and why they brought me there as well. To free him.\n> Upon entering the town, Elai showed us to our accomodation for the time being, however on the way I saw something extremely disturbing. My childhood home is standing in their base. Looking like it must have around the time of my birth. When my mother wasn't as crazy as she is now. \n> When it was time for the communal dinner, we sent Brondir and Toni to eat and tell everyone I have visions of Levistus while in reality Lynn and I went to investigate that godsforsaken house.*\n"
